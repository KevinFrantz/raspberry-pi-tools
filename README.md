# raspberry-pi-tools
This repository contains administration tools for the Raspberry Pi.

Like:
* Backuptools

For some of the tools you need to install Python.

If you want to enable a tool to be loaded at the start of a system, genereate a file like example.service in /etc/systemd/system/ and follow the instructions under https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-automatically-execute-shell-script-at-startup-boot-on-systemd-linux.
